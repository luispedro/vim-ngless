# Vim plugin for editing ngless files

Currently adds syntax highlighting for
[ngless](http://luispedro.github.io/ngless/).

This is compatible with [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), so
you should be able to just add the following line to your '.vimrc' file:

    Plugin 'luispedro/vim-ngless'
